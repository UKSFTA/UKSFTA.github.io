As of 2024, a wave of new military juntas in Africa, favoring Russian mercenaries over Western forces and UN peacekeepers, has intensified violence.\n\nThe British Government has received a request from NATO HQ to reinforce the area together with other NATO Allies.\n\nOur mission will be to bring stability to some parts of the region, provide aid to civilians, gather intel and fight terrorist groups together with other NATO Allies stationed in the region.\n",

From 1680, the other islands were colonized by the United Kingdom, but pirates remained active in the region throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. Later in 1736, French claims were granted and the archipelago was split up. \nIn 1960, Isla Pera became an official independent British and French colony, gaining limited autonomy in 1967. Till this day some parts of the internal islands are under control of both the British and French governments.\n\nWith an abundance of oil, sugar cane plantations and minerals the Islands are exporting a lot. Fruit growing was important until the 1970s, but has since been restricted to internal consumption. Fishing continues to play an important role. After 1999 tourisme is playing a big part of the economy.\n\nCurrently, pirates and drug traffickers are active around the islands and hurricanes in the region are more severe due to climate change. Different factions on the Islands wants to have a change and are anti-British/French and they want to claim their Islands back.\n\nOur  mission is to reinforce the area in the Caribbean Sea, protect the local population from attacks on and around the Islands, secure it's natural resources and work together with our American and French Allies. Furthermore support IDAP and the local government in their struggles.\n",

A ruthless paramilitary faction, the Black Rose, has seized control of the region's oil wealth and now threatens to destabilize the entire Middle East.\n\n2. THE ENEMY:\nThe Black Rose is a well-funded and disciplined force, but their strategic command rests with a secretive \"Council of 13.\" This council is our primary target. As long as they remain, the Black Rose will continue to be a threat.\n\n3. THE OBJECTIVE:\nThis campaign has one ultimate goal: the complete dismantlement of the Black Rose leadership. Over a series of sequential operations, UKSF Task Force Alpha will hunt down and eliminate every member of the Council of 13.\n\n4. THE WORLD:\nThe AO is not empty. Other factions, from nationalist militias to opportunistic warlords, also operate in the region. How we interact with them—whether we fight them, avoid them, or use them—will be critical to our success.\n\nWelcome to Sahatra.",

This represents a critical escalation: the Black Rose is transitioning from a regional threat to a global proliferator of WMDs.\n\nTHE ENEMY:\nThe last three remaining members of the Council of 13 are believed to be overseeing these production\noperations. They are highly dangerous, desperate, and will be protected by well-armed local Cartel forces and PMC elements.\n\nTHE OBJECTIVE:\nThis campaign's ultimate goal is the complete and permanent neutralisation of the Black Rose's chemical weapon production capability. This will involve hunting down and eliminating the remaining Council members, destroying all production facilities, and interdicting their supply lines.\n\nTHE TERRAIN:\nExpect extreme environmental challenges: dense jungle, high humidity, difficult terrain, and a complex human terrain dominated by powerful Cartel networks and insurgent groups.\n\nTHE STAKES:\nFailure is not an option. The proliferation of chemical weapons by the Black Rose would have catastrophic global consequences.",
