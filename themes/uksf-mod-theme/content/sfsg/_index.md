The Special Forces Support Group (SFSG) is the bedrock of Taskforce Alpha. All new recruits enter through SFSG Training Platoon to master our Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), tactical movement, and core modpack.

## Core Operational Domains

### Support & Firepower
SFSG provides the critical kinetic depth required for large-scale operations. This includes driving vehicles, providing heavy weapons fire support (GPMGs), and establishing secure cordons.

### Operational Logistics
Ensuring the frontline SF teams (SAS/SBS) are supported with transport and logistical depth during theatre operations.

## The Entry Pipeline

SFSG is the first step in your career within Taskforce Alpha.

* **Training Platoon**: New members receive high-quality training in basic tactics and community SOPs.
* **Progression**: After completing a few operations, SFSG members can choose to specialize as a medic or apply for selection into SAS, SBS, or SRR.
