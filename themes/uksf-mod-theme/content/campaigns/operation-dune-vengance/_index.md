CAMPAIGN BRIEF;

1. SITUATION:
In the power vacuum left by Iran's collapse, the province of Western Sahatra is now a failed state. A ruthless paramilitary faction, the Black Rose, has seized control of the region's oil wealth and now threatens to destabilize the entire Middle East.

2. THE ENEMY:
The Black Rose is a well-funded and disciplined force, but their strategic command rests with a secretive "Council of 13." This council is our primary target. As long as they remain, the Black Rose will continue to be a threat.

3. THE OBJECTIVE:
This campaign has one ultimate goal: the complete dismantlement of the Black Rose leadership. Over a series of sequential operations, UKSF Task Force Alpha will hunt down and eliminate every member of the Council of 13.

4. THE WORLD:
The AO is not empty. Other factions, from nationalist militias to opportunistic warlords, also operate in the region. How we interact with them—whether we fight them, avoid them, or use them—will be critical to our success.

Welcome to Sahatra.
