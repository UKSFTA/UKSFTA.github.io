Focussed around the capital city of Al-Jatar, A nation on the Persian Gulf. This semi-mountainous region rich in natural resources is home to many mines and oil fields. However these resources have left instability and conflict in the region for decades. Thunder run through the wide open valleys around the Jazira oil fields, traverse a rocky mountain pass, or move deep into the dense alleyways and streets of Farabad, a huge city at the center of the province.

A military coup made the region even more unstable. Different factions are in fight with eachother to gain control. The British Government has received a request from NATO HQ to evacuate any British embassy personnel and civilians out of the area, to gain intel and to work with our NATO partners and the previous regime.
