The United States has decided to re-enter Afghanistan in an attempt to re instate a legitimate NATO backed government as such the rest of NATO will be joining this counter insurgency effort.

Task Force Alpha is being sent to Helmand province to try and liberate the area, we will begin with the outlying rural areas and slowly move into the urban enemy strongholds over the course of this campaign. The objective is to seek, destroy and engage the Taliban and Taliban backed forces while minimising civilian casualties and destruction to civilian property.

There is a significant IED, VBIED and PBIED risk as such all soldiers sailors and airmen of TFA will be taught the use of mine detecting equipment and the engineers will specify in defusal efforts.

Please keep an eye on your individual CoCs for new SOPs that relate to you.
