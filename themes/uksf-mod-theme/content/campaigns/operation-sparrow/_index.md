Isla Pera, a lush, tropical archipelago in the Caribbean Sea. With Bocachica as its main city is founded and conquered by the United Kingdom in 1672. From 1680, the other islands were colonized by the United Kingdom, but pirates remained active in the region throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. Later in 1736, French claims were granted and the archipelago was split up. 
In 1960, Isla Pera became an official independent British and French colony, gaining limited autonomy in 1967. Till this day some parts of the internal islands are under control of both the British and French governments.

With an abundance of oil, sugar cane plantations and minerals the Islands are exporting a lot. Fruit growing was important until the 1970s, but has since been restricted to internal consumption. Fishing continues to play an important role. After 1999 tourisme is playing a big part of the economy.

Currently, pirates and drug traffickers are active around the islands and hurricanes in the region are more severe due to climate change. Different factions on the Islands wants to have a change and are anti-British/French and they want to claim their Islands back.

Our  mission is to reinforce the area in the Caribbean Sea, protect the local population from attacks on and around the Islands, secure it's natural resources and work together with our American and French Allies. Furthermore support IDAP and the local government in their struggles.
