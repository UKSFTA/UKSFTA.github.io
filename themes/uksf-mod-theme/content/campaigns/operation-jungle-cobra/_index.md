SITUATION:
Following the successful disruption of their command in Sahatra, the remnants of the Black Rose have fled to the remote, dense jungles of Colombia. Intelligence confirms they are now establishing chemical weapon production facilities, utilising local Cartel networks and resources. This represents a critical escalation: the Black Rose is transitioning from a regional threat to a global proliferator of WMDs.

THE ENEMY:
The last three remaining members of the Council of 13 are believed to be overseeing these production
operations. They are highly dangerous, desperate, and will be protected by well-armed local Cartel forces and PMC elements.

THE OBJECTIVE:
This campaign's ultimate goal is the complete and permanent neutralisation of the Black Rose's chemical weapon production capability. This will involve hunting down and eliminating the remaining Council members, destroying all production facilities, and interdicting their supply lines.

THE TERRAIN:
Expect extreme environmental challenges: dense jungle, high humidity, difficult terrain, and a complex human terrain dominated by powerful Cartel networks and insurgent groups.

THE STAKES:
Failure is not an option. The proliferation of chemical weapons by the Black Rose would have catastrophic global consequences.
