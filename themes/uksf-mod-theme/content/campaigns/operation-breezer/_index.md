An uprising has been happening in the Murmansk area '' Russia '' the last couple of months. They want to declare a own state outside Russia. Meanwhile presumably armed men from the Russian Army stationed in this area have been supporting this new regime. While Russia is busy in Ukraine fighting their 3 day '' special operation '' armed men have set up roadblocks and destroying the important road '' E105/P-21 '' down South towards the rest of Russia.
The important military harbors in the area have been seized by this new regime as well as other military installations.

At the same time the British Government has received a request from NATO HQ to reinforce the area together with other NATO Allies.
Our mission is to reinforce the area, protect the local population, secure Norwegian NATO ground and it's natural resources.

The Norwegian border area has a high rich of minerals, oil and gold in the ground. High mountain terrains, small roads and a couple of ports and a low population are in our area of operations.

Welcome to the Norwegian Fjords.
