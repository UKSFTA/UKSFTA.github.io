E Squadron represents the most sensitive capability within Taskforce Alpha. Working directly under the SIS Directorate, we conduct missions that "do not exist," operating covertly to secure strategic objectives.

## Clandestine Protocols

### Deniable Action
Operating without official recognition. E Squadron members excel in unconventional environments, often working behind enemy lines without standard support infrastructure.

### Covert Intelligence
Gathering high-priority intelligence through human surveillance and technical exploitation. We are the architects of the unseen battlespace.

## Entry & Progression

E Squadron is an invitation-only specialization. Only the most experienced and discreet operators are considered for selection.

* **Selection**: Conducted through a series of "Black" operations where candidates are assessed on their autonomy and decision-making.
* **Secrecy**: Members must adhere to strict non-disclosure protocols regarding their operational history.
* **Advanced Specialty**: Mastery of all conventional special forces skills is a prerequisite.
