The Special Reconnaissance Regiment (SRR) within Taskforce Alpha operates in the shadow domain, gathering critical intelligence in high-risk environments where conventional reconnaissance is impractical.

## Core Operational Domains

### Covert Surveillance
Monitoring high-value targets in complex environments without detection. This involves mastering low-visibility operations and technical sensor deployment.

### Intelligence Gathering
A primary function of the SRR is to identify targets for our strike elements (SAS/SBS) through persistent observation and infiltration.

## Entry & Progression

SRR is a restricted specialization within Taskforce Alpha. It is strictly **Internal Transfer Only**.

* **Requirements**: Candidates must prove excellence within SAS or SBS and receive direct approval from Taskforce Command.
* **Specialization**: Deep focus on ELINT (Electronic Intelligence), ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance), and reconnaissance protocols.
* **Selection**: Focuses on high-standard cognitive performance and simulation of covert monitoring.
