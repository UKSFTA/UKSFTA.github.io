{{< mandate id="SRR-DOSS-03" >}}
The Special Reconnaissance Regiment (SRR) provides the Directorate of Special Forces with a dedicated covert surveillance capability. Unlike other UKSF units, the SRR draws personnel from across all branches of the British Armed Forces and is the only unit to recruit women for frontline operational roles.

## Operational Role & Use Case

The SRR operates at the strategic and tactical levels, gathering human intelligence (HUMINT) and signals intelligence (SIGINT) in environments where overt military presence is not possible.

### Core Competencies

- **Covert Surveillance**: Monitoring high-value targets in urban and rural environments without detection.
- **ISTAR**: Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, and Reconnaissance supporting Tier 1 strike operations.
- **Technical Intelligence**: Integration of advanced sensors, electronic warfare assets, and cyber-insertion tools.
- **Target Tracking**: Persistent monitoring of strategic threats across international borders.

## Professional Standard

SRR operators are specialists in the "grey zone"—the space between peace and open conflict. They are trained in advanced close-quarters combat, technical surveillance, and the mastery of multiple languages and local customs.

### Integration

The SRR works in seamless integration with the SAS and SBS, providing the "eyes and ears" required for successful direct action missions and counter-terrorism response.
