## Strategic Role & The Shadow Domain

The SRR operates in the "Shadow Domain," gathering critical human intelligence (HUMINT) and technical surveillance data in high-threat environments where overt military presence is impossible.

### Core Operational Domains

- **Covert Urban Surveillance**: Monitoring targets in complex urban environments without detection, often for extended periods.
- **Human Intelligence (HUMINT)**: Establishing and maintaining sources within adversary networks to gather strategic data.
- **ISTAR Support**: Providing Tier 1 strike units (SAS/SBS) with the "Eyes and Ears" required for high-precision interventions.
- **Counter-Terrorism Surveillance**: Identifying and tracking terrorist networks both domestically and internationally.

## Professional Standard

SRR operators are specialists in blending into any environment. They are masters of "Grey Zone" operations, possessing advanced skills in:
- **Close-Quarters Combat**: High-speed, high-intensity response in confined spaces.
- **Advanced Communications**: Operating undetectable signals networks in non-permissive zones.
- **Cultural Mastery**: Deep understanding of local customs, languages, and social dynamics.

## The SRR Selection Course

Selection for the SRR focuses on cognitive speed, emotional intelligence, and the ability to operate under extreme isolation.

1. **Assesment Phase**: Testing physical and mental resilience over a 2-week course.
2. **Surveillance Training**: 14 weeks of intensive training in human and technical surveillance methods.
3. **Advanced Combat Phase**: Mastering tactical driving, close-quarters weaponry, and escape & evasion.
