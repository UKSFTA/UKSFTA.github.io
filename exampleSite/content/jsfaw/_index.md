## Strategic Role & Air Superiority

JSFAW is the "Invisible Lift" of the UKSF. Their expertise lies in the covert delivery and recovery of Tier 1 teams in all environments, utilizing advanced night-vision, terrain-following, and electronic warfare suites.

### Core Operational Domains

- **Covert Insertion**: Delivering SAS/SBS teams deep behind enemy lines using high-speed, low-level flight profiles.
- **Tactical Extraction**: Rapid recovery of teams from hostile environments under fire, often utilizing specialized winch and fast-rope techniques.
- **Battlefield Intelligence**: Utilizing advanced sensors and thermal imaging to provide Tier 1 teams with real-time theatre awareness.
- **Aviation Strike**: Providing high-precision fire support from specialized air platforms to suppress adversary forces during extraction.

## Regimental Composition

JSFAW consists of two primary operational squadrons, each specializing in a specific platform and mission set:

- **7 Squadron (RAF)**: Utilizing the Chinook HC6, specialists in heavy-lift tactical insertion and maritime recovery.
- **658 Squadron (AAC)**: Utilizing the Gazelle AH1 and Wildcat, experts in urban surveillance and rapid small-team delivery.

## Entry Standards

Personnel must already be qualified as pilots or aircrew within the RAF or Army Air Corps. Selected candidates undergo the **JSFAW Operational Course**, focusing on:
- **Night-Vision Mastery**: Extreme low-level flight in zero-visibility conditions.
- **Non-Permissive Landing**: Landing in unprepared, hostile, or confined zones.
- **Electronic Warfare**: Operating in environments with heavy radar and signals interference.
