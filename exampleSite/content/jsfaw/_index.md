The Joint Special Forces Aviation Wing (JSFAW) provides the Directorate with dedicated, high-readiness aviation support. Integrating assets from the RAF and Army Air Corps, JSFAW is the **"Invisible Lift"** of the UKSF, delivering Tier 1 teams into non-permissive environments with zero detection.

## Strategic Role & Air Superiority

JSFAW is specialized in extreme low-level flight, often utilizing terrain-following radar and advanced night-vision suites to operate in conditions that would ground conventional air assets.

### Core Operational Domains

* **Covert Air Insertion**: Delivering SAS/SBS teams deep behind enemy lines using high-speed, low-level flight profiles to avoid radar detection.
* **Tactical Extraction**: Rapid recovery of teams from hostile environments under fire, utilizing specialized fast-rope and winch recovery techniques.
* **Battlefield Intelligence**: Providing real-time theatre awareness to ground teams via advanced thermal imaging and signals interception sensors.
* **Aviation Fire Support**: Delivering precision suppression from specialized air platforms to secure extraction zones in contested territory.

## Regimental Composition

JSFAW consists of two primary operational squadrons, each specializing in a specific platform:

* **7 Squadron (RAF)**: Utilizing the Chinook HC6, specialists in heavy-lift tactical insertion, long-range maritime recovery, and high-altitude delivery.
* **658 Squadron (AAC)**: Utilizing the Gazelle AH1 and Wildcat, experts in rapid urban delivery and covert surveillance.

## Entry Standards & Training

<div id="intake"></div>

Personnel must already be qualified as pilots or aircrew within the RAF or Army Air Corps. Candidates undergo the **JSFAW Operational Course**, widely considered one of the most dangerous aviation training programs in the military.

### Training Focus
* **Night-Vision Mastery**: Mastery of high-speed, low-level flight in absolute zero-visibility conditions.
* **Hostile Environment Landing**: Mastery of landing in unprepared, confined, or contested zones without ground support.
* **Electronic Warfare**: Operating aircraft within heavy adversary radar and signals jamming environments.
