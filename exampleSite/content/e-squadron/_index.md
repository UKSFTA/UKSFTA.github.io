E Squadron, historically referred to as 'The Increment', is a joint-service unit of the United Kingdom Special Forces. Composed of handpicked personnel from the SAS, SBS, and SRR, the squadron operates at the highest level of strategic sensitivity, often conducting missions where official British military presence must remain entirely deniable.

## Core Operational Domains

### 1. Strategic Deniability
E Squadron is specialized in missions that require a near-zero footprint. Operators are trained to utilize non-standard equipment, civilian identities, and irregular tactics to achieve strategic objectives in environments where a Tier 1 strike force is not politically viable.

### 2. SIS (MI6) Liaison & Support
The squadron acts as the primary kinetic arm for the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS). This includes providing close protection for intelligence officers in high-threat zones, conducting clandestine extractions of high-value human assets, and performing technical sabotage missions directed by the intelligence services.

### 3. Clandestine Infiltration
Mastery of multi-modal, non-conventional infiltration methods. This involves the use of deep-cover identities, commercial transit networks, and high-speed littoral platforms to insert teams into non-permissive regions with zero detection.

## The Joint-Service Model

Unlike regimental squadrons, E Squadron is a composite unit. It draws upon the specific domain expertise of its parent units:
- **SAS Personnel**: Specialists in unconventional land-warfare and high-stakes CT.
- **SBS Personnel**: Experts in maritime infiltration and sub-surface operations.
- **SRR Personnel**: Masters of technical and urban surveillance.

## Selection & Induction

<div id="intake"></div>

There is no public selection course for E Squadron. Personnel are **Handpicked** from the existing Tier 1 pool based on outstanding operational records, psychological stability, and specialized linguistic or technical skills.

### Key Requirements:
- **Registry Check**: Candidates must already be badged members of the SAS, SBS, or SRR.
- **Vetting**: Highest-level Developed Vetting (DV) with deep-background screening.
- **Operational Tenure**: Minimum of two full operational tours within a Tier 1 regiment.
