## Strategic Role & Maritime Domain

The SBS is the world leader in maritime special operations. Their expertise lies in the "Transition Zone"—the space between deep water and the shoreline—as well as the protection of strategic national maritime interests.

### Core Operational Domains

- **Maritime Counter-Terrorism (MCT)**: The SBS maintains the permanent high-readiness response for threats to oil platforms, commercial shipping, and naval assets. They are the primary force for "Ship-in-Ship" intervention.
- **Amphibious Reconnaissance**: Gathering critical intelligence on coastal defenses, beachheads, and port infrastructure prior to larger-scale military operations.
- **Underwater Demolition**: Specialized sabotage of naval targets, underwater infrastructure, and strategic maritime assets using advanced technical diving equipment.
- **Littoral Strike**: Rapid, covert insertion and offensive operations in coastal environments, often utilizing high-speed surface craft or sub-surface delivery vehicles.

## Regimental Specialization

The SBS is organized into specialized squadrons, each maintaining a specific technical focus:

- **C Squadron**: Specialists in sub-surface and canoeing operations.
- **Z Squadron**: Experts in high-speed surface craft and maritime mobility.
- **M Squadron**: The primary squadron for maritime counter-terrorism and ship intervention.
- **X Squadron**: Focused on technical intelligence and experimental maritime insertion platforms.

## The Selection Standard

The SBS selection process mirrors the SAS Aptitude phase but requires an additional, highly specialized **Maritime Phase**.

1. **Aptitude Phase**: Shared with the SAS, conducted in the Brecon Beacons.
2. **Boats Phase**: Conducted at RM Poole, testing underwater proficiency, cold-water endurance, and the mastery of specialized maritime insertion platforms.
3. **Operational Diving**: Achieving a high standard of tactical diving using rebreathers and technical sub-surface navigation.
