The Special Boat Service (SBS) is the UK's specialist in the littoral and maritime domains. Based at RM Poole, the regiment is primarily composed of Royal Marines but remains a tri-service asset. The SBS projects UK special operations capability from the sea to the shore, mastering the "Transition Zone" where deep water meets contested coastlines.

## Core Operational Domains

### Maritime Counter-Terrorism (MCT)
The SBS maintains the permanent high-readiness response for threats to oil platforms, commercial shipping, and naval assets. They are the world's primary force for **Ship-in-Ship** intervention and offshore facility recovery.

### Amphibious Reconnaissance
Gathering critical intelligence on coastal defenses, beachheads, and port infrastructure prior to larger-scale military operations. This involves covert sub-surface insertion and persistent monitoring of strategic maritime lanes.

## Regimental Specialization

The SBS is organized into four specialized squadrons, each maintaining a specific technical and environmental focus:

- **C Squadron**: Specialists in sub-surface insertion, canoeing, and tactical diving.
- **Z Squadron**: Experts in high-speed surface craft, maritime mobility, and aerial insertion.
- **M Squadron**: The primary squadron for maritime counter-terrorism and complex ship intervention.
- **X Squadron**: Focused on technical intelligence gathering and experimental maritime insertion platforms.

## The Selection Standard

The SBS selection process mirrors the SAS Aptitude phase but requires an additional, highly specialized **Maritime Phase** at RM Poole.
