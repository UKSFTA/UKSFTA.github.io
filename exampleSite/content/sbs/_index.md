The Special Boat Service (SBS) is the UK's specialist in the littoral and maritime domains. Based at RM Poole, the regiment is primarily composed of Royal Marines but remains a tri-service asset. The SBS projects UK special operations capability from the sea to the shore, mastering the "Transition Zone" where deep water meets contested coastlines.

## Core Operational Domains

### 1. Maritime Counter-Terrorism (MCT)
The SBS maintains the permanent high-readiness response for threats to oil platforms, commercial shipping, and naval assets. They are the world's primary force for **Ship-in-Ship** intervention and offshore facility recovery.

### 2. Amphibious Reconnaissance
Gathering critical intelligence on coastal defenses, beachheads, and port infrastructure prior to larger-scale military operations. This involves covert sub-surface insertion and persistent monitoring of strategic maritime lanes.

### 3. Underwater Demolition & Sabotage
Specialized sabotage of naval targets, underwater infrastructure, and strategic maritime assets. Operators utilize advanced technical diving equipment and rebreathers to operate undetected for extended periods.

## Regimental Specialization

The SBS is organized into four specialized squadrons, each maintaining a specific technical and environmental focus:

*   **C Squadron**: Specialists in sub-surface insertion, canoeing, and tactical diving.
*   **Z Squadron**: Experts in high-speed surface craft, maritime mobility, and aerial insertion.
*   **M Squadron**: The primary squadron for maritime counter-terrorism and complex ship intervention.
*   **X Squadron**: Focused on technical intelligence gathering and experimental maritime insertion platforms.

## The Selection Standard

### The Selection Phases:
1.  **Aptitude Phase**: Shared with 22 SAS, conducted across the Brecon Beacons.
2.  **Boats Phase**: Conducted at RM Poole, testing underwater proficiency, cold-water endurance, and the mastery of specialized maritime insertion platforms.
3.  **Operational Diving**: Achieving a high standard of tactical diving using rebreathers and technical sub-surface navigation.
