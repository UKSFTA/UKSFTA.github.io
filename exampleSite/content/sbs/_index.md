## Operational Role & Use Case

The SBS is the UK's specialist in the littoral and maritime domains. They are the primary asset for projecting UKSF power from the sea to the shore, capable of underwater insertion and high-speed maritime intervention.

### Core Competencies

- **Maritime Counter-Terrorism (MCT)**: Specialized response for oil platforms, commercial shipping, and naval assets.
- **Amphibious Reconnaissance**: Gathering intelligence on beachheads, port infrastructure, and coastal defenses.
- **Underwater Demolition**: Technical sabotage of maritime targets and strategic naval assets.
- **Littoral Strike**: Rapid insertion and offensive operations in the transition zone between sea and land.

## Structure & Specialization

The SBS is organized into C, Z, M, and X Squadrons, each with specific domain expertise ranging from sub-surface diving to high-speed surface craft operations.

### Selection Standard

SBS Selection mirrors the SAS Aptitude phase but adds a secondary "Boats" phase. This requires operators to achieve a high standard of underwater proficiency, maritime navigation, and cold-water endurance.
