United Kingdom Special Forces recruitment is a multi-tier process. The Directorate operates a unified selection gateway. Most personnel will initiate their special operations career within the Special Forces Support Group (SFSG) before attempting Tier 1 Selection.

## The Selection Standard

The Directorate looks for individuals who demonstrate mental resilience, physical endurance, and technical aptitude beyond the conventional military standard. Selection is not a competition against others, but an unrelenting pursuit of personal excellence.

### Physical Fitness Benchmarks
Before initiating a selection packet, personnel must achieve the following minimum standards:
- **Combat Fitness Test (CFT)**: 12.8km (8 miles) in 1h 50m with 25kg load.
- **Swimming Proficiency**: 500m in uniform followed by 2 minutes of treading water.
- **Advanced Navigation**: Successful completion of complex night navigation exercises in non-permissive terrain.

## The JSFC Career Pathway

The path to becoming a UKSF Operator is defined by three primary stages:

### 1. The Briefing Note (Phase 0)
Once an interest packet is accepted, candidates receive a **Briefing Note**. This provides the specific coordinates and dates for the initial assessment week. This phase remains entirely confidential.

### 2. SFSG Foundation
For many, the Special Forces Support Group serves as the primary integration point. SFSG provides the essential tactical depth and high-readiness training required to support Tier 1 missions. Outstanding performers in SFSG are the primary pool for Tier 1 selection scouts.

### 3. Tier 1 Selection (SAS/SBS)
The 6-month selection course for the SAS and SBS. It is designed to strip away the conventional soldier and find the individual capable of operating in the "Grey Zone" with zero external support.

## Security & Vetting
All applicants must be able to achieve **Developed Vetting (DV)** status. This involves an extensive background check into personal history, financial status, and international associations.
