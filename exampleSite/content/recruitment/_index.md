United Kingdom Special Forces recruitment is a multi-tier process. The Directorate operates a unified selection gateway. Most personnel will initiate their special operations career within the Special Forces Support Group (SFSG) before attempting Tier 1 Selection.

## The JSFC Career Pathway

The Directorate looks for elite performance across all domains. Whether you are aiming for the SAS, SBS, or the Rangers, the journey begins here.

### 1. Foundation: SFSG Entry
The Special Forces Support Group serves as the primary integration point for elite infantry and specialist support personnel. While SFSG does not utilize a "Selection" phase in the traditional SAS sense, entry is highly competitive and based on regimental recommendation or handpicked selection during high-readiness training.

### 2. Tier 1 & Tier 2 Selection
Once established within the Directorate support framework, or if highly qualified from regular units, personnel may register interest for the formal Selection pipelines:
- **22 SAS / SBS Selection**: The world's most rigorous assessment.
- **Ranger Regiment Selection**: Focused on partner-nation integration and asymmetric warfare.
