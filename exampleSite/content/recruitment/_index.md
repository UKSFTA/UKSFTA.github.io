United Kingdom Special Forces recruitment is simulated through Taskforce Alpha's joint-service assessment. Our intake process ensures that every member is trained to a high standard before entering the operational rotation.

## The Recruitment Pipeline

TFA follows a structured entry standard. Candidates move through the following gateways:

1. **Application & Interview**: Initial screening via our secure Discord to ensure maturity and technical readiness.
2. **Phase 1: Basic Training (1 Week)**: Mastery of Basic CQB, Section Tactics, Radio Protocols, and the core unit modpack.
3. **Phase 2: Progression Training (2-4 Weeks)**: Advanced skills development within SFSG, including specialized weaponry and medical training.
4. **Operational Probation**: Candidates must complete **2 full weeks of operations** within SFSG before they are eligible to apply for advanced specialization.

## The Entry Standard

TFA entry is not a competition; it is a validation of your ability to operate as part of a high-fidelity milsim team.

### Primary Entry Points

- **SFSG Support**: The required starting point for all ground-based operators. Master the fundamentals of Special Forces support.
- **JSFAW Ground Crew**: The starting point for all aviation candidates. Prove your competence on the ground before moving to rotary flight training.

- **SBS**: Maritime Operations and Amphibious Warfare.
- **British Army Rangers**: Partner Force Integration and Asymmetric Warfare.
