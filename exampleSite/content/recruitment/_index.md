United Kingdom Special Forces recruitment is a joint-service assessment. The Directorate operates a unified selection gateway designed to identify individuals with the mental resilience, physical endurance, and technical aptitude to operate in non-permissive environments.

## The Selection Standard

UKSF selection is not a competition against other candidates; it is an unrelenting pursuit of personal excellence. The Directorate looks for "The Unrelenting Pursuit of Excellence" and the ability to operate independently under extreme duress.

### 1. Phase 0: The Briefing Note
Once an initial interest packet is accepted and verified against MOD databases, candidates receive a **Briefing Note**. This document provides the specific coordinates, dates, and equipment requirements for the initial assessment week. This phase is conducted under strict confidentiality.

### 2. Phase 1: Aptitude (The Hills)
Conducted in the Brecon Beacons, this 4-week phase is designed to test a candidate's endurance and navigation skills. 
- **The Fan Dance**: A 24km timed march over Pen y Fan with a 25kg load.
- **Endurance (The Long Drag)**: A final 64km (40-mile) march over the highest peaks of the Beacons, to be completed in under 20 hours.

### 3. Phase 2: Tactical & Jungle
Successful candidates move to 14 weeks of intensive tactical training.
- **Advanced Weaponry**: Mastery of foreign and domestic weapon systems.
- **Combat Medicine**: Specialized training in prolonged field care.
- **Jungle Phase**: Conducted in Brunei or Belize, testing the ability to live and fight in the world's most demanding tropical environments.

## Minimum Entry Requirements

Before submitting an interest packet, personnel must confirm they meet the following baseline criteria:

- **Service History**: Minimum 2 years regular service in the British Army, Royal Navy, or Royal Air Force.
- **Medical Category**: Full Medical Category A (Elite). Candidates with persistent injuries or psychological markers will be automatically filtered.
- **Vetting Status**: Applicants must be eligible for **Developed Vetting (DV)**. This involves a comprehensive review of personal, financial, and family history.

### Special Forces Support Group (SFSG) Pathway
For elite infantry personnel from the Parachute Regiment, Royal Marines, and RAF Regiment, the SFSG provides a high-readiness foundation. While SFSG does not utilize the 6-month Tier 1 selection, it is the primary entry point for candidates aiming for eventual SAS/SBS progression.
