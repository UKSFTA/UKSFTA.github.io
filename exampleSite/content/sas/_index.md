The Special Air Service (SAS) remains the model for elite special operations forces globally. Established during the Western Desert Campaign of WWII, the regiment has evolved into a multi-domain force capable of projecting British strategic interests in any environment—land, air, or sea.

## Core Operational Domains

### Counter-Terrorism (CT)
22 SAS maintains the permanent **National Readiness** unit for domestic and international counter-terrorism. This includes advanced hostage rescue, aircraft/maritime intervention, and counter-insurgency operations. Operators are trained to neutralize threats with surgical precision under extreme time pressure.

### Strategic Reconnaissance (SR)
Gathering strategic and tactical intelligence deep behind enemy lines is a core regimental competency. Utilizing advanced human and technical surveillance assets, SAS teams provide the Directorate with high-fidelity theatre awareness long before overt military presence is initiated.

### Direct Action (DA)
The conduct of high-precision strikes, technical sabotage, and offensive operations against High-Value Targets (HVTs) or critical infrastructure. These missions are characterized by rapid insertion, decisive kinetic effect, and covert extraction.

## Regimental Structure

The regiment is organized into four operational squadrons (A, B, D, and G), each maintaining a specific insertion and environmental specialization:

*   **Air Troop**: Specialists in high-altitude parachute insertion (HAHO/HALO).
*   **Boat Troop**: Experts in maritime insertion, tactical diving, and littoral combat.
*   **Mobility Troop**: Specialists in long-range patrolling and vehicle-mounted operations in desert, arctic, and urban environments.
*   **Mountain Troop**: Masters of vertical insertion, high-altitude combat, and extreme cold-weather survival.
