## Strategic Role & Deployment

22 SAS maintains a global presence, operating in small, autonomous teams to achieve high-impact strategic outcomes. The regiment is designed for "zero-latency" deployment, capable of inserting into non-permissive environments with minimal notice.

### Core Operational Domains

- **Counter-Terrorism (CT)**: 22 SAS maintains the permanent National Readiness unit for domestic and international counter-terrorism. This includes advanced hostage rescue, aircraft/maritime intervention, and counter-insurgency operations.
- **Direct Action (DA)**: Conduct of high-precision strikes, technical sabotage, and offensive operations against High-Value Targets (HVTs) or critical infrastructure.
- **Special Reconnaissance (SR)**: Gathering strategic and tactical intelligence deep behind enemy lines using advanced human and technical surveillance assets.
- **Unconventional Warfare**: Training and leading partner nation forces, supporting revolutionary insurgent operations, and conducting asymmetric warfare.

## Regimental Structure

The regiment is organized into four operational squadrons (A, B, D, and G), each specializing in a specific insertion and environmental domain:

- **Air Troop**: Specialists in HAHO (High Altitude High Opening) and HALO (High Altitude Low Opening) parachute insertion.
- **Boat Troop**: Specialists in maritime insertion, diving, and littoral operations.
- **Mobility Troop**: Experts in desert, arctic, and urban vehicle operations and long-range patrolling.
- **Mountain Troop**: Specialists in high-altitude combat, vertical insertion, and extreme cold-weather survival.

## The Selection Pipeline

Selection for the SAS is the most demanding military assessment in the world. It is designed to find individuals who possess "The Unrelenting Pursuit of Excellence" and the ability to operate independently under extreme psychological and physical duress.

1. **Aptitude Phase (The Hills)**: A 4-week assessment in the Brecon Beacons testing endurance, navigation, and mental resilience under heavy load.
2. **Tactical Phase**: Intensive training in advanced weapon systems, demolition, and tactical medicine.
3. **Jungle Phase**: Combat operations and survival in hostile tropical environments.
4. **Combat Survival (SERE)**: Advanced Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Extraction assessment.
