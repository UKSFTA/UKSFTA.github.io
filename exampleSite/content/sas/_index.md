## Operational Role & Use Case

The primary mission of 22 SAS is to provide the UK government with a range of specialized military options. Operators are trained to insert into any environment—land, air, or sea—to achieve strategic objectives with zero latency.

### Core Competencies

- **Counter-Terrorism (CT)**: Maintaining the national high-readiness response team for domestic and international hostage rescue and strike operations.
- **Direct Action**: High-precision offensive operations against high-value targets and strategic infrastructure.
- **Special Reconnaissance**: Gathering intelligence deep behind enemy lines through human and technical surveillance.
- **Unconventional Warfare**: Training partner nation forces and supporting revolutionary insurgent operations.

## Structure & Selection

The regiment is structured into several operational squadrons, each specializing in a specific insertion method (Air, Boat, Mobility, Mountain).

### The Selection Pipeline

Selection for the SAS is widely regarded as the most demanding military assessment in the world. It tests mental resilience, physical endurance, and the ability to operate independently under extreme duress.

1. **Aptitude Phase**: The "Hills" phase, involving heavy load-bearing and complex navigation across the Brecon Beacons.
2. **Tactical Phase**: Mastery of advanced weapon systems, demolition, and medical protocols.
3. **Jungle Phase**: Survival and combat operations in hostile tropical environments.
4. **SERE**: Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Extraction training.
