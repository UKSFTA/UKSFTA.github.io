## Shadow Domain Integration

UKSFTA's intelligence capability is a multi-layered ecosystem designed to bridge the gap between technical signals interception and human-centric surveillance. By integrating the **Special Reconnaissance Regiment (SRR)** and **SF Signals**, the Taskforce maintains a persistent presence in high-threat environments.

### The Intelligence Lifecycle: Find, Fix, Finish

In the Shadow Domain, operational success is defined by the seamless linkage of these distinct pillars:

- **SF Signals (SIGINT/Fix)**: The technical baseline. They intercept, decrypt, and analyze adversary command networks, providing the "Electronic Fingerprint" required to fix a target's location.
- **Special Reconnaissance Regiment (HUMINT/Find)**: The human-centric fixation. SRR urban teams provide persistent, covert surveillance to confirm identities and identify kinetic entry points.
- **Taskforce Alpha Elements (Strategic Finish)**: The final effect. Utilizing the data provided by SRR and Signals to conduct high-precision strikes and non-conventional missions.

## Strategic Selection Node

Personnel with advanced technical, cyber, or Zeus expertise may register interest for the intelligence selection pipeline.
