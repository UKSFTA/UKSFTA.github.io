## Operational Overview

Following intelligence reports of a non-conventional threat to strategic maritime infrastructure in the London domain, M Squadron (SBS) initiated a high-speed intervention protocol. This operation served as a critical validation of the Directorate's ability to project Tier 1 power into complex urban-maritime environments.

### Key Objectives

- **Vessel Intervention**: Covert boarding and securing of high-tonnage commercial assets.
- **Infrastructure Protection**: Establishing secure cordons around strategic river crossings and utility nodes.
- **Inter-Agency Coordination**: Seamless integration with the Metropolitan Police Specialist Firearms Command (CTSFO) and the Royal Navy.

## Technical Execution

The operation utilized a combination of high-speed surface craft and aerial insertion via JSFAW assets. Operators achieved full control of the primary objective within 12 minutes of the initial handshake.

- **Insertion Method**: Fast-rope recovery and sub-surface approach.
- **Environmental State**: Urban / Littoral Transition.
- **Outcome**: Objective secured. Zero civilian latency.
