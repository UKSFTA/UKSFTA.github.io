## Operational Overview

During the primary offensive in the Tora Bora cave complex, SBS teams conducted a high-stakes interdiction mission to trap Al-Qaeda leadership. The operation demonstrated the SBS's versatility in extreme mountain environments, far removed from their traditional maritime specialization.

### Key Objectives
- **Target Containment**: Blocking strategic mountain passes to prevent HVT escape.
- **Precision CAS Integration**: Guiding high-fidelity air strikes onto deep-cave fortifications.
- **Direct Action Assault**: Clearing non-permissive subterranean complexes under extreme environmental duress.

## Technical Execution

Teams inserted via high-altitude overland mobility and established observation points on the primary ridgelines. Utilizing advanced thermal sensors and laser target designators, the SBS coordinated a 72-hour air-kinetic strike that degraded adversary command structures significantly.

- **Insertion Method**: High-Altitude Overlanding.
- **Environmental State**: Alpine / Subterranean.
- **Outcome**: Primary cave systems cleared. Strategic leadership dispersed. Archive data recovered.
