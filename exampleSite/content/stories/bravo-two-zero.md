In January 1991, during the opening nights of the Gulf War, an eight-man patrol from B Squadron (22 SAS) inserted deep behind enemy lines into Northern Iraq. The patrol, designated 'Bravo Two Zero', was tasked with establishing an observation post along the primary Main Supply Route (MSR) between Baghdad and Syria. Their objective was to identify and interdict mobile Scud missile launchers being used against coalition cities.

The patrol inserted via a Chinook HC1 helicopter and moved to a designated 'hide' in an arid, rocky environment. Almost immediately, the team faced extreme environmental challenges, including record-low temperatures and unexpected snowfall. On the second day, the patrol was compromised by local irregular forces, leading to a fierce firefight against superior numbers of the Iraqi Army.

Faced with a compromised position and failing communication hardware, the patrol initiated an escape and evasion (E&E) protocol. They attempted to reach the Syrian border on foot, carrying heavy combat loads over hundreds of kilometers of non-permissive terrain. The trek remains one of the most remarkable feats of physical endurance in special forces history.

The patrol was eventually scattered. Three members were killed during the E&E phase, and four were captured and held as prisoners of war until the conflict's end. One member, Chris Ryan, successfully evaded capture, covering 300km on foot over eight days to reach safety in Syria.

Despite the compromise, the mission provided critical intelligence on adversary communication infrastructure and forced the Iraqi command to divert significant assets to MSR protection. The story of Bravo Two Zero has since become a cornerstone of SAS regimental lore, representing the "Unrelenting Pursuit of Excellence" even in the face of tactical failure.
