## 1. Situation
In January 1991, an eight-man SAS patrol (Designation: Bravo Two Zero) inserted into Northern Iraq. The mission was to interdict Scud missile launch sites and strategic communication cables being used against coalition cities.

- **Adversary**: Iraqi Army (Regular and Republican Guard).
- **Environment**: High-desert, non-permissive terrain with extreme temperature fluctuations.
- **ROE**: Covert interdiction; self-defense kinetic force authorized.

## 2. Mission
To establish persistent observation of the Main Supply Route (MSR) between Baghdad and Syria, identify Scud launch points, and neutralize strategic communication infrastructure.

## 3. Execution (CONOPS)
- **Phase 1: Infiltration**: Insertion via Chinook HC1 (JSFAW) into a designated Landing Zone (LZ) behind enemy lines.
- **Phase 2: Observation**: Establishment of a covert 'hide' to monitor MSR traffic and communication nodes.
- **Phase 3: Compromise & E&E**: Following detection by local irregulars, the patrol initiated Escape & Evasion (E&E) protocols on foot, covering over 300km toward the Syrian border.

## 4. Mission Assessment
- **Intelligence Status**: High-fidelity surveillance data provided to coalition air-assets prior to compromise.
- **Patrol Status**: 3 KIA; 4 captured (later released); 1 (Chris Ryan) successfully reached Syria.
- **Strategic Value**: Demonstrated the extreme endurance limits of Tier 1 autonomous operations.
