## Operational Overview

During the opening phases of the Gulf conflict, an eight-man SAS patrol (Designation: Bravo Two Zero) inserted into Northern Iraq to interdict adversary Scud missile launchers. The mission demonstrated the extreme endurance required for autonomous operations in non-permissive desert terrain.

### Key Objectives
- **MSR Interdiction**: Monitoring and disrupting the Main Supply Route between Baghdad and the West.
- **Strategic Reconnaissance**: Identifying Scud launcher positions for coalition air strike interdiction.
- **Technical Sabotage**: Destruction of strategic communication cables.

## Technical Execution

The patrol inserted via heli-borne delivery and established a persistent observation post. Following a compromise of the primary hide, the team conducted a tactical extraction on foot under heavy fire, covering over 300km toward the Syrian border.

- **Insertion Method**: Heli-Borne / Tactical Land.
- **Environmental State**: High-Arid Desert / Extreme Cold.
- **Outcome**: Strategic cables destroyed. Patrol compromised. High-fidelity theatre awareness provided prior to extraction.
