REGISTRY ARCHIVE: The Pebble Island Raid. A classic validation of the Tier 1 airfield interdiction and sabotage capability.
{{< /mandate >}}

During the 1982 Falklands conflict, the Argentine airfield at Pebble Island posed a significant threat to British naval operations. The base hosted FMA IA 58 Pucará ground-attack aircraft and T-34 Mentors, which could be used to interdict the planned British landings. The Directorate authorized D Squadron (22 SAS) to neutralize these assets in a high-speed direct action raid.

The operation was launched on the night of 14 May 1982. 45 operators from D Squadron were inserted via Sea King helicopters from HMS Hermes. To achieve tactical surprise, the assault was coordinated with a naval gunfire support from HMS Glamorgan, which provided a diversionary bombardment of the island's western end.

The SAS teams moved covertly toward the airfield, carrying heavy loads of explosives and anti-tank weaponry. The assault was fast and decisive. Using explosive charges and M203 grenade launchers, the teams systematically destroyed eleven Argentine aircraft on the ground. They also neutralized the base’s radar installation and fuel stockpiles.

The entire ground phase lasted less than 45 minutes. Despite being engaged by Argentine small arms fire, the SAS teams successfully extracted via the Sea Kings with only two minor casualties. The raid effectively neutralized the threat from Pebble Island, ensuring the British task force could proceed with the San Carlos landings with reduced risk from land-based air assets.
