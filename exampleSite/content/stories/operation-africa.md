## Operational Overview

1 RANGERS initiated a persistent deployment within the West African domain to enhance the counter-insurgency capabilities of local partner forces. This operation serves as a validation of the Ranger Regiment's ability to operate embedded within foreign command structures to achieve strategic influence.

### Key Objectives
- **Tactical Mentorship**: Training local infantry units in advanced asymmetric tactics and precision strike operations.
- **Intelligence Liaison**: Establishing a persistent human intelligence network to monitor regional insurgency threats.
- **Grey Zone Persistence**: Maintaining a continuous British presence to stabilize contested geographic zones without a Tier 1 footprint.

## Technical Execution

The operation required deep cultural and linguistic mastery. Small teams of Rangers lived and trained alongside local forces for a 6-month rotation, providing the technical and tactical expertise required to degrade adversary logistics networks.

- **Deployment Profile**: Long-Term Embedded.
- **Environmental State**: Complex Rural / Savannah.
- **Outcome**: Local capability increased by 40%. Insurgent activity reduced in the primary theatre of operations.
