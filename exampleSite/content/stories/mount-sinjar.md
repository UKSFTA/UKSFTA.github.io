REGISTRY ARCHIVE: Mount Sinjar Humanitarian Intervention. High-stakes reconnaissance and target interdiction during the opening of Operation Shader.
{{< /mandate >}}

In August 2014, the rapid advance of the Islamic State (ISIS) into Northern Iraq forced tens of thousands of Yazidi civilians to flee into the Sinjar Mountains. Trapped without food, water, or medicine, and surrounded by adversary forces, the situation reached a humanitarian crisis point. The Directorate was tasked with establishing a reconnaissance and protection protocol to enable large-scale aid delivery and eventual extraction.

A joint SAS and SBS team inserted via heli-borne assets onto the Mount Sinjar ridgeline under the cover of darkness. Their primary objective was to gather technical intelligence on adversary positions and provide the Directorate with high-fidelity theatre awareness.

The operators established observation points and utilized advanced signals intelligence to monitor ISIS command networks. They also coordinated with coalition air assets to conduct precision kinetic strikes against ISIS heavy weaponry that was targeting the refugee populations.

The presence of the UKSF teams was critical in stabilizing the mountain's defenses. They worked alongside Kurdish Peshmerga forces, providing tactical advice and coordinating the air-drops of life-saving supplies. The intelligence gathered by the teams allowed for the planning of a successful ground corridor that eventually enabled the extraction of the majority of the trapped population.

The Mount Sinjar intervention demonstrated the Directorate's ability to operate in the complex 'Grey Zone', where humanitarian protection and strategic kinetic effect must be perfectly balanced.
