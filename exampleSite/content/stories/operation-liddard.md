REGISTRY ARCHIVE: Operation Liddard. High-speed desert extraction and citizen recovery in a collapsing state.
{{< /mandate >}}

In February 2011, as the Libyan civil war intensified, hundreds of British and international oil workers were stranded in remote desert locations across the Cyrenaica region. With the host nation’s security forces in collapse and local militias establishing non-permissive checkpoints, the Directorate initiated a high-speed extraction protocol designated 'Operation Liddard'.

The mission was a joint-service effort utilizing SAS and SBS teams, supported by C-130 Hercules assets from the RAF. The operation required multiple clandestine landings on unprepared desert airstrips deep within contested territory.

Over the course of 48 hours, UKSF teams moved covertly to various oil fields, coordinating the assembly and protection of the stranded workers. The technical challenge was immense: landing heavy transport aircraft on soft sand strips under the threat of local anti-aircraft assets.

Two C-130s conducted a daring landing at a remote location south of Benghazi, where SAS teams had secured a temporary perimeter. Over 150 civilians were recovered in a single lift. Simultaneously, SBS teams conducted littoral reconnaissance along the coast to identify secondary extraction nodes.

Operation Liddard was a total success, resulting in the safe recovery of over 500 international workers with zero casualties. The mission demonstrated the Directorate’s ability to project power into vast, non-permissive geographic zones to achieve humanitarian and strategic objectives.
