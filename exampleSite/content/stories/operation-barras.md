In late August 2000, 11 members of the Royal Irish Regiment and their Sierra Leonean liaison officer were captured by the 'West Side Boys' militia while on patrol. The captives were taken to Gberi Bana, a reinforced stronghold deep in the riparian jungle of Sierra Leone. When negotiations by the British Army liaison team broke down and threats of execution became credible, the Directorate of Special Forces was tasked with a rescue mission.

Operation Barras was one of the most complex joint-service missions in UKSF history. It required the simultaneous assault on two separate militia bases located on opposite sides of the Rokel Creek: Gberi Bana (where the hostages were held) and Magbeni (the primary militia garrison).

The operation was launched at dawn on 10 September 2000. Three Chinook HC2s and a Lynx AH7 from the Joint Special Forces Aviation Wing (JSFAW) conducted a high-speed, low-level approach along the river to achieve acoustic surprise. The noise of the helicopters was used to mask the insertion of the ground teams.

D Squadron (22 SAS) fast-roped directly into the center of the Gberi Bana compound. The fighting was intense and conducted at close quarters as the SAS teams moved to secure the hostages. Simultaneously, SBS teams used high-speed surface craft to secure the river transit routes and prevent militia escape via the water.

To prevent the militia at Magbeni from reinforcing Gberi Bana, a reinforced company of the Special Forces Support Group (SFSG), primarily composed of 1 PARA, launched a heavy-weapons assault on the second stronghold. Utilizing mortars and heavy machine guns, they pinned down over 400 militia members, allowing the Tier 1 teams to complete the hostage recovery.

The extraction was completed within 20 minutes of the initial breach. All 11 British personnel were recovered and flown to the RFA Sir Percivale. The West Side Boys' command structure was effectively destroyed. The mission came at a cost, however, with one SAS operator, Sergeant Bradley Tinnion, being killed during the extraction phase.
