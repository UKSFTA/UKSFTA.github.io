On 25 October 2020, the crude oil tanker MV Nave Andromeda, in transit from Lagos to Southampton, reported a violent stowaway situation while anchored near the Isle of Wight. Seven irregular militants had threatened the crew and attempted to seize control of the vessel's bridge. Given the proximity to strategic national infrastructure, the Home Secretary authorized a Tier 1 maritime counter-terrorism (MCT) response.

The mission was assigned to M Squadron of the Special Boat Service (SBS). Under the cover of total darkness, the SBS initiated a high-speed, multi-platform boarding protocol that remains a masterclass in modern MCT.

Technical overwatch was provided by JSFAW Wildcat helicopters, which established persistent thermal surveillance and provided sniper coverage for the assault teams. As the Wildcats maintained a low-altitude orbit around the tanker, two Chinook HC6 assets conducted a synchronized fast-rope insertion directly onto the deck.

Simultaneously, four high-speed surface craft approached the stern of the vessel, with boarding teams utilizing vertical ladders to gain secondary entry points. The synchronization of the air and sea teams achieved total tactical surprise. The SBS operators, equipped with advanced night-vision and close-quarters weaponry, secured the bridge, engine room, and crew quarters with surgical precision.

The entire vessel was under official control within nine minutes of the first operator setting foot on the deck. All 22 members of the ship's crew were found safe and unharmed in the citadel. The seven stowaways were detained and transferred to the custody of Hampshire Constabulary.

The Nave Andromeda intervention served as a high-visibility demonstration of the SBS's ability to project power and restore order to high-tonnage assets under extreme time pressure.
