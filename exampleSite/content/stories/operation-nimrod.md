## 1. Situation
On 30 April 1980, six armed militants of the Democratic Revolutionary Front for the Liberation of Arabistan (DRFLA) seized the Iranian Embassy in London. Following the execution of a hostage on Day 6, the Home Secretary authorized the Directorate to initiate a kinetic solution.

- **Adversary**: 6 armed militants (DRFLA).
- **Environment**: Multi-storey urban townhouse, heavily barricaded.
- **ROE**: Hostage extraction primary; lethal force authorized for threat neutralization.

## 2. Mission
To conduct a synchronized, multi-point assault on 16 Princes Gate to extract all remaining assets and neutralize the militant threat with surgical precision.

## 3. Execution (CONOPS)
The operation (designated 'Operation Nimrod') was executed via two main assault teams (Red Team and Blue Team).

- **Phase 1: Infiltration**: Red Team established positions on the roof while Blue Team prepared first-floor entry points. Technical surveillance (microphones and optical probes) provided real-time HVT locations.
- **Phase 2: Breach & Entry**: At 19:23 ZULU, Red Team fast-roped from the roof to the rear balconies while Blue Team utilized explosive frame-charges on the first-floor windows. CS gas was deployed to saturate the interior.
- **Phase 3: Clearance**: Operators conducted systematic room-by-room clearance. Five of the six militants were neutralized within the structure; one was identified while attempting to blend with hostages and detained.

## 4. Mission Assessment
- **Asset Status**: 25 hostages successfully recovered; 1 civilian fatality (pre-assault).
- **Adversary Status**: 5 KIA; 1 detainee.
- **Strategic Effect**: Global validation of the 'Black Role' counter-terrorism capability.
