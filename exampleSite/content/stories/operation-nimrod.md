"The Directorate authorized 22 SAS to initiate a kinetic solution. The objective was total dominance of the target location within a zero-latency window."

On 30 April 1980, six armed militants of the Democratic Revolutionary Front for the Liberation of Arabistan (DRFLA) stormed the Iranian Embassy at 16 Princes Gate, London. Taking 26 hostages, the group demanded the release of prisoners in Khuzestan and their own safe passage out of the UK. For six days, a tense standoff ensued as Metropolitan Police negotiators attempted to resolve the crisis peacefully.

The turning point occurred on the sixth day when the militants executed a diplomatic staff member and threw his body onto the street. Within minutes, the Home Secretary authorized the Special Air Service to initiate a kinetic solution.

Under the cover of darkness and intense public scrutiny, B Squadron (22 SAS) prepared for 'Operation Nimrod'. Red Team established positions on the roof while Blue Team moved to the rear balconies and first-floor entry points. Technical teams had spent days drilling through adjacent walls to plant microphones and optical probes, providing the assault teams with high-fidelity target locations.

At 19:23 ZULU, the assault began. Synchronized explosive frame-charges shattered the first-floor windows as Red Team operators fast-roped from the roof to the rear balconies. Despite a minor complication where one operator became entangled in his rope, the teams breached the structure simultaneously. CS gas was deployed to saturate the interior, creating a disorienting environment for the militants.

The room-by-room clearance was surgical. Operators moved through the smoke-filled embassy with respirators, identifying and neutralizing the militants while shielding hostages. In the library, where the majority of hostages were held, SAS teams neutralized several gunmen before they could execute their captives. In total, the assault lasted only 17 minutes.

The outcome was a resounding validation of Tier 1 urban intervention. Five militants were killed during the assault, and one was captured while attempting to blend in with the extracted hostages. All but one of the remaining hostages were recovered safely.
