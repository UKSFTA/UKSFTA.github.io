## Operational Overview

Operating from autonomous forward bases, SAS patrols conducted persistent monitoring of High-Value Targets (HVTs) within contested mountain environments. The mission demonstrated the Regiment's capacity for extreme-endurance patrolling and decisive kinetic effect with zero external footprint.

### Key Objectives

- **Persistent Surveillance**: 14-day covert observation of trans-border adversary logistics networks.
- **Kinetic Intervention**: Precision strike against strategic command and control nodes.
- **Intelligence Gathering**: Recovery of sensitive technical documents and communication hardware.

## Technical Execution

Teams inserted via HAHO (High Altitude High Opening) parachute profiles to minimize acoustic signatures. Operations were conducted in extreme terrain, requiring advanced mountain warfare proficiency and high-fidelity thermal surveillance.

- **Insertion Method**: HAHO / Long-Range Infiltration.
- **Environmental State**: High-Altitude / Mountain.
- **Outcome**: Strategic target neutralized. Archive data recovered for Directorate analysis.
