"The objective was the total neutralization of Al-Qaeda strategic logistics. Operation Trent demonstrated the Special Boat Service's capacity for extreme-range autonomous strike."

In November 2001, following the coalition invasion of Afghanistan, intelligence identified a primary Al-Qaeda narcotics processing and logistics facility in the Helmand domain. This compound served as a critical financial and command node for the regional insurgency. The Directorate authorized a large-scale kinetic strike, designated 'Operation Trent', to neutralize the facility.

Operation Trent remains the largest single deployment of the Special Boat Service in its modern history. It required the full regimental strength to conduct a long-range desert penetration of over 1000km from the primary coalition base.

The operation utilized heavily armed Mobility Troop Land Rovers and ATVs, equipped with .50 caliber machine guns and automatic grenade launchers. The multi-day overland approach was conducted at high speed across non-permissive terrain, demonstrating the SBS's ability to operate far outside of its traditional maritime domain.

As the column reached the target compound, the assault was coordinated with precision air-strikes from US Navy F-14 Tomcats and F/A-18 Hornets. Once the perimeter defenses were softened, over 80 SBS operators conducted a high-speed vehicle-borne assault, breaching the compound walls and engaging the Al-Qaeda garrison at close quarters.

The fighting was intense and lasted several hours. Operators methodically cleared the facility, recovering high-value hard-drives and technical communication hardware before utilizing specialized demolition to level the structure completely.

The mission was a total success. The Al-Qaeda funding and logistics pipeline in the sector was 100% neutralized, and critical intelligence was recovered for Directorate analysis. While four Tier 1 operators were wounded during the assault, all were successfully extracted and recovered.
