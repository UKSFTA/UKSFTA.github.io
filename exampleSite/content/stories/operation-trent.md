## Operational Overview

Operation Trent remains one of the largest SBS deployments in modern history. The mission involved a long-range desert penetration to destroy a strategic Al-Qaeda logistics and funding node. The operation utilized over 80 operators and demonstrated the unit's ability to operate far outside of its traditional maritime domain.

### Key Objectives
- **Logistics Destruction**: Total neutralization of an industrial-scale opium processing facility.
- **Intelligence Recovery**: Seizure of high-level adversary communication hardware.
- **Strategic Disruption**: Breaking the financial link between regional narcotics and global terrorism.

## Technical Execution

The operation utilized heavily armed Pink Panther Land Rovers and ATVs for a multi-day desert infiltration. The assault was coordinated with Close Air Support (CAS) to suppress superior adversary numbers during the final breach.

- **Insertion Method**: Long-Range Mobility / Overland.
- **Environmental State**: High-Desert / Arid.
- **Outcome**: Target facility destroyed. Significant intelligence recovered. Several Tier 1 operators wounded but recovered.
