REGISTRY ARCHIVE: Operation Mikado. Strategic reconnaissance and deterrence protocol during the 1982 South Atlantic conflict.

During the height of the Falklands conflict in 1982, the Argentine Navy's Super Etendard aircraft, armed with Exocet missiles, posed a critical threat to the British Task Force. Following the successful strike on HMS Sheffield, the British command authorized a high-risk mission to neutralize these air assets at their source: the Rio Grande airbase on the Argentine mainland.

The original concept for Operation Mikado was ambitious and hazardous. It involved two C-130 Hercules transport aircraft conducting a crash-landing on the Rio Grande runway, delivering 55 SAS operators from B Squadron who would then destroy the Exocet stockpiles and aircraft before attempting an extraction.

Before the primary assault could be launched, a small reconnaissance element was inserted via a Sea King helicopter to establish an observation post and gather technical intelligence on the base's defenses. However, the mission faced immediate environmental and technical challenges. The helicopter was forced to land in Chilean territory due to fuel exhaustion and thick fog, and the presence of the team was compromised.

Despite the fact that the primary kinetic phase was eventually aborted due to the loss of tactical surprise and the high risk of catastrophic asset loss, Operation Mikado achieved a significant strategic effect. The mere detection of Special Forces presence forced the Argentine command to redeploy large numbers of elite infantry and radar assets from the islands back to the mainland to protect their airbases.

This redeployment significantly degraded the adversary's defensive posture in the primary theatre of operations, contributing to the eventual success of the British land campaign. Operation Mikado remains a primary example of how Tier 1 assets can achieve strategic deterrence and influence without firing a shot.
