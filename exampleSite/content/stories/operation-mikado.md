## 1. Situation
During the Falklands conflict, the threat of Exocet missiles launched from Super Etendard aircraft required a Tier 1 solution to neutralize the assets on the Argentine mainland.

- **Adversary**: Argentine Naval Aviation (6th Naval Fighter Squadron).
- **Environment**: Fortified mainland airbase with high-density radar and infantry perimeters.
- **ROE**: Strategic sabotage primary; lethal force authorized for extraction.

## 2. Mission
To conduct a covert incursion into Rio Grande Airbase to neutralize Exocet stockpiles and Super Etendard airframes.

## 3. Execution (CONOPS)
- **Phase 1: Preliminary Recon**: A small SAS team (Sea King insertion) conducted a covert approach to Tierra del Fuego to establish an observation post.
- **Phase 2: Primary Assault (Planned)**: Two C-130 Hercules aircraft were tasked with a crash-landing on the runway to deliver 55 operators for immediate direct action.
- **Phase 3: Abort**: Due to technical compromise and the detection of the reconnaissance element, the primary airborne phase was aborted.

## 4. Mission Assessment
- **Strategic Impact**: While the kinetic phase was aborted, the detection of SAS presence forced the adversary to redeploy significant defensive assets to the mainland, degrading their capability in the primary theatre.
- **Outcome**: 100% mission awareness achieved; strategic deterrence successful.
