## Operational Overview

Following the threat posed by Exocet missile strikes to coalition naval assets, the Directorate initiated a high-risk infiltration protocol. Operation Mikado was designed to neutralize the adversary's strategic air-launch capability through a direct action strike on the Rio Grande airbase.

### Key Objectives
- **Asset Neutralization**: Destruction of Super Etendard airframes and Exocet missile stockpiles.
- **Pilot Interdiction**: Neutralization of the specialized aircrew capable of delivering strategic ordinance.
- **Strategic Deterrence**: Projecting Tier 1 power onto the adversary mainland.

## Technical Execution

The operation utilized a combination of sea-borne approach and planned C-130 crash-landing infiltration. While the primary airborne phase was aborted due to technical compromise, the initial reconnaissance phases provided the Directorate with critical intelligence on South Atlantic air defense networks.

- **Insertion Method**: Planned C-130 Tactical Landing / SBS Boat Approach.
- **Environmental State**: Coastal Urban / Airfield.
- **Outcome**: Operation aborted post-reconnaissance. Strategic deterrence achieved.
