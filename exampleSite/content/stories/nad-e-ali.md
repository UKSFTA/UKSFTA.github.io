## 1. Situation
During the initial assault phases of Operation Moshtarak, SAS/SBS interdiction teams targeted high-level insurgent command nodes within Nad-e Ali. Superior adversary numbers required the deployment of high-readiness specialist support.

- **Adversary**: Reinforced insurgent defensive units.
- **Environment**: Densely packaged urban agricultural centre.
- **ROE**: Lethal suppressive fire authorized to protect Tier 1 maneuver and secure extraction.

## 2. Mission
To establish and maintain impenetrable cordons around target compounds, provide heavy-weapons suppression of adversary counter-attacks, and reinforce Tier 1 assets during large-scale room clearance.

## 3. Execution (CONOPS)
SFSG provided the "Combat Power" layer, allowing Tier 1 teams to focus on surgical intervention.

- **Deployment**: Rapid insertion via heli-borne and ground-mobility layers.
- **Perimeter Control**: Establishment of technical observation posts and heavy-weapons (L111A1 / Javelin) positions to block insurgent reinforcement.
- **Kinetic Support**: Providing secondary assault waves to secure large-scale agricultural compounds once the primary threat was neutralized.

## 4. Mission Assessment
- **Cordon Integrity**: Zero breach of secure zones during the 72-hour operational window.
- **Tactical Support**: Successfully enabled four Tier 1 HVT interdictions.
- **Outcome**: Insurgent command structure in Nad-e Ali effectively degraded.
