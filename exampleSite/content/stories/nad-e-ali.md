During the opening phases of Operation Moshtarak, SFSG provided the critical tactical depth required for SAS/SBS interdiction teams to neutralize strategic command nodes. The unit maintained impenetrable cordons against overwhelming insurgent numbers, allowing Tier 1 assets to achieve surgical precision.

The operation was a validation of the SFSG's mastery of combined-arms support. Working in seamless integration with armored assets and Tier 1 teams, the unit demonstrated the ability to hold ground in non-permissive urban environments.

- **Insertion Method**: Ground Infiltration / Air Assault.
- **Environmental State**: Densely Packaged Urban.
