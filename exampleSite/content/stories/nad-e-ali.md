In February 2010, coalition forces launched Operation Moshtarak, the largest offensive of the conflict in Afghanistan, aimed at removing the Taliban from their stronghold in central Helmand. A critical component of this offensive was the Battle of Nad-e Ali, where the Special Forces Support Group (SFSG) played a decisive role in enabling Tier 1 interdiction missions.

The SFSG, primarily composed of personnel from the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment, provided the essential 'Combat Power' layer for the operation. While SAS and SBS teams focused on surgical strikes against high-level insurgent command nodes, the SFSG was tasked with establishing and maintaining impenetrable cordons around the target zones.

The fighting in Nad-e Ali was characterized by intense urban-rural transition combat. SFSG operators utilized high-mobility ground platforms and heli-borne insertion to seize strategic compound clusters. Once in position, the unit deployed heavy weapons, including L111A1 machine guns and Javelin anti-tank missiles, to block insurgent escape routes and prevent external reinforcement.

During the 72-hour operational window, the SFSG successfully held four primary cordon lines against repeated insurgent counter-attacks. Their mastery of heavy tactical weaponry and advanced signals integration allowed the Tier 1 teams to operate with total focus on their surgical objectives.

The Battle of Nad-e Ali demonstrated the SFSG's foundational importance to the Directorate. By providing technical tactical depth and decissive kinetic support, they ensured that the strategic interdiction missions were successful with zero breach of the secure zones.
