{{< /mandate >}}

In November 2001, following the fall of Mazar-i-Sharif, hundreds of captured Al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters were held at the Qala-i-Jangi fortress. On 25 November, the prisoners launched a violent uprising, seizing the fortress’s armory and capturing two US intelligence officers. A small team from the Special Boat Service (SBS), operating in the region, was tasked with a high-stakes intervention to recover the assets and stabilize the fortress.

The SBS teams arrived at the fortress as the uprising reached its peak. Under heavy fire from superior numbers of well-armed prisoners, the SBS operators established a defensive perimeter and initiated a counter-assault. The fighting was some of the most intense close-quarters combat in modern special forces history, lasting for six days.

Working alongside US Special Forces and Northern Alliance units, the SBS utilized precision air-strikes and direct kinetic action to clear the fortress compound by compound. The teams demonstrated remarkable bravery, often engaging the adversary at distances of less than 10 meters.

The intervention successfully neutralized the uprising and prevented a large-scale escape of high-value detainees. While one US intelligence officer was killed in the initial uprising, the SBS's rapid response was critical in preventing further loss of life and securing the strategic fortress. Two SBS operators were awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) and Conspicuous Gallantry Cross (CGC) for their actions during the battle.
