## 1. Situation

Transnational insurgent movements in the Sahel domain required a persistent, lighter-footprint British military capability to stabilize key geographic zones and enhance local counter-terrorism effectiveness.

- **Adversary**: Transnational insurgent cells (Decentralized / Asymmetric).
- **Environment**: Desert / Savannah transition zone with limited logistics infrastructure.
- **ROE**: Mentorship and leadership authorized; kinetic force authorized for self-defense and partner protection.

## 2. Mission

To provide high-fidelity training, leadership, and technical intelligence support to partner nation forces to degrade insurgent capabilities and stabilize regional border zones.

## 3. Execution (CONOPS)

The operation utilized a persistent, embedded presence to achieve strategic influence over a 6-month rotation.

- **Phase 1: Integration**: Ranger teams established long-term residency within partner command structures, mastering local linguistic and cultural dynamics.
- **Phase 2: Mentorship**: Delivery of specialized training in asymmetric tactics, precision fire-support coordination, and secure signals intelligence.
- **Phase 3: Persistence**: Leading joint partner-nation patrols into non-permissive border zones to monitor insurgent transit and disrupt logistics networks.

## 4. Mission Assessment

- **Capability Increase**: Partner nation kinetic effectiveness improved by 35% across monitored units.
- **Strategic Impact**: Persistent presence established without the requirement for large-scale conventional forces.
- **Logistics Effect**: 40% reduction in trans-border insurgent traffic within the primary sector.
