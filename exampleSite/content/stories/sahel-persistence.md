{{< /mandate >}}

## Operational Overview

2 RANGERS deployed to the Sahel domain to provide high-fidelity training and leadership to partner nation forces engaged in counter-insurgency operations. This operation serves as a cornerstone of the Ranger Regiment's mandate to operate embedded with foreign forces to achieve long-term strategic stability.

### Key Objectives
- **Tactical Capacity Building**: Enhancing the kinetic and technical proficiency of local counter-terrorism units.
- **Intelligence Liaison**: Developing a persistent regional surveillance network to track transnational insurgency movements.
- **Asymmetric Leadership**: Leading partner-force patrols into non-permissive border zones to degrade adversary logistics.

## Technical Execution

The operation required advanced cultural empathy and linguistic mastery. Ranger teams operated in remote, high-threat border zones, providing the technical expertise required to coordinate precision air strikes and secure communications for local commanders.

- **Deployment Profile**: Persistent Embedded Training.
- **Environmental State**: Desert / Savannah Transition.
- **Outcome**: Partner force lethality increased by 35%. Trans-border insurgency transit reduced in the primary sector.
