## Operational Role & Use Case

The Rangers are specialists in "capacity building"—working alongside partner nation forces to enhance their capabilities in high-threat environments. They are the Army's primary asset for "grey zone" operations that require a lighter footprint than Tier 1 assets.

### Core Competencies
- **Partner Force Integration**: Training and leading international partners in unconventional warfare.
- **Complex Contested Environments**: Operating in the transition space between peace and large-scale combat.
- **Asymmetric Strike**: Conducting precision strikes and tactical sabotage in support of strategic objectives.

## Selection Standard

Ranger selection, while distinct from SAS/SBS selection, is highly rigorous. It focuses on cultural intelligence, language mastery, and the ability to operate effectively while embedded with foreign forces.
