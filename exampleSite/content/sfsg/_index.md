## Strategic Role & Support Depth

SFSG acts as the primary assault force for large-scale UKSF missions. While Tier 1 teams focus on precision target intervention, SFSG provides the necessary "combat power" to secure operational zones and suppress superior adversary forces.

### Core Operational Domains

- **Assault Support**: Providing secondary assault waves, secure cordons, and heavy weapons support during SAS/SBS direct action missions.
- **Cordon Operations**: Establishing and maintaining impenetrable perimeters in urban and rural environments to isolate targets.
- **Specialist Weaponry**: Mastery of heavy tactical weapon systems, including mortars, anti-tank missiles, and advanced fire support tools.
- **CBRN Response**: Specialist high-readiness response for operations in chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear environments.

## Entry & Progression

SFSG is the primary entry point for special operations careers in the UKSF. It draws its personnel from the Parachute Regiment (1 PARA), the Royal Marines, and the RAF Regiment.

### The Handpicked Protocol
Unlike the SAS/SBS Selection, the SFSG utilizes a **Handpicked Entry** model:
- **Registry of Interest**: Outstanding performers in parent units can register via the terminal above to be tracked by Directorate scouts.
- **SFSG Induction**: Selected candidates undergo a rigorous 4-week Special Forces Support course to master the unit's advanced tactics and equipment.
- **Tier 1 Pipeline**: SFSG operators are the most successful candidates for future Tier 1 Selection attempts.
