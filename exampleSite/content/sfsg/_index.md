### Core Competencies
- **Direct Action Support**: Assault support for Tier 1 counter-terrorism and hostage rescue missions.
- **Cordon Operations**: Establishing secure operational zones in contested urban or rural environments.
- **Specialist Weaponry**: Mastery of heavy tactical weapon systems and mortars.
- **CBRN Response**: Specialist training in chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear environments.
