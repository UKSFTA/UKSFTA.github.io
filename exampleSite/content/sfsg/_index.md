The Special Forces Support Group (SFSG) is the Directorate's primary kinetic force multiplier. It serves as the bedrock of the JSFC, where elite personnel from the Parachute Regiment (1 PARA), Royal Marines, and RAF Regiment are forged into special operations support specialists. 

## Strategic Role & Support Depth

SFSG acts as the primary assault force for large-scale UKSF missions. While Tier 1 teams focus on precision target intervention, SFSG provides the necessary **Combat Power** to secure operational zones and suppress superior adversary forces.

### Core Operational Domains

*   **Assault Support**: Providing secondary assault waves, secure cordons, and heavy weapons support during SAS/SBS missions.
*   **Cordon Operations**: Establishing impenetrable perimeters in urban and rural environments to isolate targets and prevent external interference.
*   **Specialist Weaponry**: Mastery of heavy tactical weapon systems, including mortars, anti-tank missiles (Javelin), and advanced fire support tools.
*   **CBRN Response**: High-readiness response for operations in chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear environments.

## The Directorate Foundation

SFSG is where most careers in the UKSF begin. It provides the essential tactical grounding required for eventual progression into Tier 1 selection courses.

### Entry Protocol

<div id="intake"></div>

Unlike Tier 1 units, the SFSG does not run a public "Selection" course. Instead, the unit utilizes a **Handpicked Entry** system:

1.  **Regimental Recommendation**: Outstanding performers in parent units are recommended by their Commanding Officers for SF support duty.
2.  **SFSG Induction**: Selected candidates undergo a rigorous 4-week Special Forces Support course to master the unit's advanced tactics and equipment.
3.  **Internal Pipeline**: SFSG operators are the primary candidates for future SAS/SBS Selection attempts.
