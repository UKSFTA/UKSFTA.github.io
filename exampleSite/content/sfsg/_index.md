The Special Forces Support Group (SFSG) is the Directorate's primary kinetic force multiplier. It serves as the bedrock of the JSFC, where elite personnel from the Parachute Regiment, Royal Marines, and RAF Regiment are forged into special operations support specialists.

## The Directorate Foundation

SFSG is where most careers in the UKSF begin. It provides the essential combat support and tactical depth required for SAS and SBS missions. 

### Entry Protocol
Unlike Tier 1 units, the SFSG does not run a public "Selection" course. Instead, the unit utilizes a **Handpicked Entry** system:
- **Regimental Recommendation**: Outstanding performers in donor units are recommended by their COs.
- **Registration of Interest**: Personnel can register interest via the terminal below to be tracked for future intake cycles.
- **Internal Progression**: SFSG operators are the primary candidates for eventual SAS/SBS Selection attempts.

## Operational Role
SFSG operators are masters of the high-readiness assault. They provide secure perimeters, secondary strike waves, and specialized weapon support during Tier 1 counter-terrorism and direct action missions globally.
