UKSF delivers strategic utility across all domains of conflict. By integrating elite human selection with technological overmatch, we maintain the sovereign edge in global reconnaissance and intervention.

## Strategic Overview

The Directorate of Special Forces (DSF) manages the United Kingdom’s special operations capability. This gateway provides authorized access to regimental dossiers and command-level operational archive data.

### Mission Domains

Our capability is projected through four primary strategic pillars:

1. **Precision Intervention**: Real-time counter-terrorism and hostage rescue response teams maintained at high readiness.
2. **Global ISTAR**: Strategic reconnaissance and deep-penetration surveillance operations in contested theatres.
3. **Capacity Building**: Training and advising partner nation forces to support regional stability and UK interests.
4. **Electronic Superiority**: Integration of kinetic physical force with offensive cyber and signals intelligence operations.

> "To provide the United Kingdom with a range of specialist military options that provide strategic advantage in an increasingly complex world." — DSF Command Mandate

## The Joint Force Architecture

The UKSF component is a tri-service command structure, drawing elite personnel from the British Army, Royal Navy, and Royal Air Force.

| Command Unit | Primary Focus | Service Origin |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **22 SAS Regiment** | Land Operations / CT | British Army |
| **Special Boat Service** | Maritime Operations / CT | Royal Navy / RM |
| **Special Recon Regiment** | ISTAR / Surveillance | Tri-Service |
| **Special Forces Support Group** | Support / Direct Action | Tri-Service |

## Operational Selection Protocol

Selection for UKSF is the most rigorous process in the British Military. Applicants are drawn from across the armed forces and must undergo a multi-phase assessment designed to test mental endurance, physical capacity, and technical aptitude.

### High-Readiness Deployment

- **Response Time**: Sub-2-hour deployment capacity for domestic CT assets.
- **Global Reach**: 24/7 coverage of all priority global operational sectors.
- **Interoperability**: Seamless integration with JSFAW (Aviation) and SIS (Intelligence) partners.
