This guide provides a comprehensive breakdown of the technical and doctrinal sources required to build the UKSF milsim infrastructure. These sources are categorized to assist the system's AI and developers in understanding the specific role each reference plays in achieving a professional, modular, and immersive environment.

### 1. Design System and Visual Branding

These sources provide the CSS variables, components, and brand guidelines necessary to replicate the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and UK Government digital aesthetic.

* **MOD.UK Design System (`@moduk/frontend`):** The primary source for accessible components like accordions, tabs, and notification banners tailored for internal MOD services. It includes the brand color palette (e.g., `$moduk-brand-colour` #532a45) and ensures WCAG 2.1 compliance.


* **GOV.UK Hugo Theme (`govukhugo`):** The technical framework used to bridge the MOD Design System with the Hugo static site generator. It provides the base scaffold for dashboards and book-style content.


* **Service-Specific Branding:** Guidelines for the British Army, Royal Navy, and RAF to ensure branch-specific pages (SAS, SBS, etc.) maintain thematic accuracy while using approved fonts like Effra or Arial as fallbacks.

### 2. Core Site Engine and Content Architecture

These sources define how the website organizes data, handles Obsidian-style filing, and manages modular updates.

* **Hugo Content Management:** Documentation on "Page Bundles" and `_index.md` files, which are essential for creating the deep, hierarchical sections required for the RSIS portal and branch silos.


* **Obsidian-to-Hugo Pipeline:** Patterns for using Obsidian as a headless CMS, leveraging YAML front matter for metadata and custom `render-link.html` files to support Obsidian Wikilinks in a web environment.
* **Modular Blocks and Layouts:** Technical guidance on using Hugo "Blocks" to create reusable page components that fit perfectly on mobile and desktop without static assets.

### 3. Community Data and External Integrations

These sources provide the API protocols and sync methods for Steam, Battlemetrics, and Discord.

* **Discord.js & Role Syncing:** Libraries and bot patterns used to monitor Discord member roles and dynamically update the website’s `roster.json` and ORBAT.


* **Steam Web API & RCON:** Documentation for the `ISteamUserStats` interface to pull player counts and the Source RCON `A2S_INFO` queries for real-time server tracking.


* **Battlemetrics Integration:** Methods for utilizing OAuth 2.0 Bearer tokens to retrieve historical server activity and uptime graphs.



### 4. Intelligence Simulation and Security

These sources outline the thematic gating of the RSIS portal through technical challenges and administrative tiers.

* **CTF Gateway Patterns:** Examples of easy-to-moderate Capture-The-Flag challenges, including HTML inspection, ROT13/Base64 decoding, and mock SQL injection for gated access.


* **Static Site Gating:** Strategies for placing content behind login portals on static hosts like GitHub Pages or Netlify, including the use of JWTs or administrative login tiers.

### 5. ORBAT Visualization and Canvas

These sources provide the logic for rendering dynamic military structures.

* **Canvas API and Libraries:** Implementation guides for `Arbor.js` and `milsymbol.js` to draw interactive unit hierarchies on an HTML5 canvas based on JSON data.
* **Arma 3 ORBAT Standards:** NATO symbology and unit size codes used to ensure the simulated ORBAT matches Arma 3's internal `CfgORBAT` structures.

### 6. Production Environment and CI/CD

These sources define the "professional environment" standards for testing and maintenance.

* **Unified Linting (Biome):** Documentation for Biome, the primary tool for JavaScript, CSS, and JSON linting/formatting in a single binary.


* **GitHub Actions CI/CD:** Workflow patterns for automated testing, Lighthouse audits, and secure deployment to GitHub Pages using GPG-signed commits.


* **AGENTS.md and Roadmap:** Patterns for creating AI-driven maintenance logs and automated todo lists for technical officers.



### 7. Military Doctrinal Context

These sources provide the "lore" and structural accuracy for the unit branches.

* **Special Forces Support Units:** Organizational history and roles for the 18 Signal Regiment and E-Squadron to inform the RSIS portal's intelligence theme.


* **Branch-Specific Missions:** Contextual data for the Army Special Operations Brigade (ASOB) and Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) to ensure their sections reflect realistic special operations tasking.
