We are under-equipped until the rest of our convoy reaches our location.\n\nMission:\nUKSF has been tasked with reconnaissance of Chernarus, finding a suitable location to settle a permanent FOB and possibly retrieving old technology that is otherwise in working order, or can be restored to working order.\n\nToday, we got a little headsup that might help us.",

Intelligence confirms they are now establishing chemical weapon production facilities, utilising local Cartel networks and resources. This represents a critical escalation: the Black Rose is transitioning from a regional threat to a global proliferator of WMDs.\n\nTHE ENEMY:\nThe last three remaining members of the Council of 13 are believed to be overseeing these production\noperations. They are highly dangerous, desperate, and will be protected by well-armed local Cartel forces and PMC elements.\n\nTHE OBJECTIVE:\nThis campaign's ultimate goal is the complete and permanent neutralisation of the Black Rose's chemical weapon production capability. This will involve hunting down and eliminating the remaining Council members, destroying all production facilities, and interdicting their supply lines.\n\nTHE TERRAIN:\nExpect extreme environmental challenges: dense jungle, high humidity, difficult terrain, and a complex human terrain dominated by powerful Cartel networks and insurgent groups.\n\nTHE STAKES:\nFailure is not an option. The proliferation of chemical weapons by the Black Rose would have catastrophic global consequences.",
