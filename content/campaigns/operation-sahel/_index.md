The Sahel region:

The Sahel has a hot semi-arid climate and stretches across the southernmost latitudes of North Africa between the Atlantic Ocean and the Red Sea. Traditionally, most of the people in the Sahel have been semi-nomads, farming and raising livestock in a system of transhumance.
French is spoken widely in the Sahel, as many of its nations are former French colonies, with two adopting French as an official language and many more using it colloquially.
The Sahel includes parts of Senegal, Mauritania, Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Sudan and Eritrea, where French is employed to varying degrees.

In the wake of the Libyan Crisis beginning in 2011, terrorist organizations operating in the Sahel, including Boko Haram, Islamic State and al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), have greatly exacerbated the violence, extremism and instability of the region. As of 2024, a wave of new military juntas in Africa, favoring Russian mercenaries over Western forces and UN peacekeepers, has intensified violence.

The British Government has received a request from NATO HQ to reinforce the area together with other NATO Allies.

Our mission will be to bring stability to some parts of the region, provide aid to civilians, gather intel and fight terrorist groups together with other NATO Allies stationed in the region.
