Situation:
Following the "Day of Ashes" mass-casualty terrorist attack on UK soil, intelligence has identified the perpetrator as Al-Khaima Front (AKF), a transnational terrorist organization. AKF operates a sophisticated and compartmentalized network spanning the UK and a foreign sanctuary known as "Lythium."

The network's cross-border finance, logistics, and international coordination are controlled by a single high-value individual codenamed 'THE FERRYMAN'.

Mission:
UKSF has been tasked with conducting phased counter-terrorism operations to locate, disrupt, and dismantle the AKF leadership and infrastructure, neutralizing their capability to conduct further attacks against the UK and it's allies.
