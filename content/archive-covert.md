OFFICIAL SENSITIVE: This dossier coordinates the Directorate’s covert intelligence and deniable capabilities. Access is restricted to personnel operating within the Shadow Domain.

## Military Intelligence Integration

The Directorate’s intelligence capability is a multi-layered ecosystem designed to bridge the gap between technical signals interception and human-centric surveillance. By integrating the Special Reconnaissance Regiment (SRR), the 18 Special Forces Signals Regiment, and E Squadron (The Increment), the Directorate maintains a persistent, deniable presence in high-threat environments.

### The Intelligence Lifecycle: Find, Fix, Finish

In the Shadow Domain, operational success is defined by the seamless linkage of these three distinct pillars:

- **18 Signals Regiment (SIGINT/Fix)**: The technical baseline. 18 Signals intercept, decrypt, and analyze adversary command networks. They provide the "Electronic Fingerprint" required to fix a target's location and communication patterns.
- **Special Reconnaissance Regiment (HUMINT/Find)**: The human-centric fixation. Once a technical lead is established, SRR urban teams deploy to provide persistent, covert surveillance. They confirm identities, monitor social dynamics, and identify kinetic entry points with zero visual signature.
- **E Squadron (Strategic Finish/Liaison)**: The deniable effect. Working in direct liaison with the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS/MI6), E Squadron utilizes the data provided by SRR and Signals to conduct sensitive, non-conventional missions where official military footprint must be sanitized.

## Strategic Intelligence Selection

Personnel with advanced technical, cyber, or linguistic expertise may register interest for the intelligence selection pipeline. This assessment focuses on cognitive speed, technical mastery, and the ability to operate under extreme isolation.
