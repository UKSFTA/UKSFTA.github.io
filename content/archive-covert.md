## Special Forces Intelligence Ecosystem

The Directorate projects power through the seamless integration of Human Intelligence (HUMINT) and Signals Intelligence (SIGINT). This ecosystem is composed of the Special Reconnaissance Regiment (SRR) and the 18 Special Forces Signals Regiment, working in tandem to identify, track, and enable Tier 1 kinetic interventions.

### Operational Synergy: The Grey Zone
In modern conflict, the "Grey Zone" represents the space between peace and open warfare. Our intelligence assets operate persistently in this domain, providing the Directorate with high-fidelity theatre awareness without the signature of a Tier 1 strike force.

- **Phase 1: Identification**: 18 Signals intercept and analyze adversary command networks to identify strategic threats.
- **Phase 2: Fixation**: SRR urban teams establish persistent surveillance to confirm target identities and environmental dynamics.
- **Phase 3: Execution**: Intelligence assets provide real-time data-links to SAS or SBS teams to achieve surgical kinetic effect.
