## The Strategic Intelligence Triad

The Directorate projects power through three specialized pillars of intelligence. This ecosystem integrates human surveillance, signals interception, and strategic deniability to identify and neutralize threats globally before they reach a kinetic threshold.

### 1. Special Reconnaissance Regiment (SRR)
The **Find** component. Specialists in high-fidelity human intelligence (HUMINT) and covert urban surveillance. The SRR provides the persistent "eyes on target" required for Tier 1 intervention.

### 2. 18 Special Forces Signals Regiment
The **Fix** component. Experts in signals intelligence (SIGINT) and electronic warfare. 18 Signals intercept and analyze adversary networks, providing the technical data-links that anchor all UKSF operations.

### 3. E Squadron (The Increment)
The **Finish & Support** component. A joint-service unit composed of handpicked SAS, SBS, and SRR personnel. E Squadron operates in direct support of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS/MI6), conducting the most sensitive missions requiring total strategic deniability.

## Intelligence Selection Gateway

Personnel with advanced technical, cyber, or surveillance expertise may register interest for covert roles. Vetting at the highest level (DV) is mandatory for all pathways.
