## Strategic Operational Mandate

United Kingdom Special Forces (UKSF) are a directorate of the Ministry of Defence (MOD) that provides a unique and world-class capability. Our mission is to protect the United Kingdom's interests, at home and overseas, by delivering unconventional military options.

### Operational Philosophy

Our approach is defined by the "Always a Little Further" philosophy. We integrate elite human performance with cutting-edge technological superiority to operate in environments where conventional forces cannot.

1. **Strategic Reconnaissance**: Deep-penetration surveillance and target acquisition in contested environments.
2. **Direct Action**: High-precision strike operations and counter-terrorism interventions.
3. **Unconventional Warfare**: Asymmetric operations and support to partner nation forces.
4. **Counter-Terrorism**: Domestic and international hostage rescue and CT response.

## Selection & Readiness

UKSF selection is widely regarded as one of the most demanding military courses in the world. It is open to all members of the British Armed Forces who demonstrate the requisite physical and mental resilience.

### The Selection Pipeline

The path to the Directorate is broken down into five distinct phases of increasing intensity:

- **Briefing & Vetting**: Initial security screening and operational overview.
- **Aptitude & Endurance**: The "Hills" phase, testing navigation and stamina.
- **Selection**: The primary endurance phase in hostile environments.
- **Tactical Training**: Mastery of weapon systems and unconventional tactics.
- **Probationary Period**: Integration into active operational squadrons.
