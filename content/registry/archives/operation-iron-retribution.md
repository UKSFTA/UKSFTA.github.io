## Intelligence Summary (INTSUM)

**DTG:** 071800Z JAN 26  
**SERIAL:** UKSF-TF-ALPHA-INTSUM-2026-01-07-001  
**CLEARANCE:** SECRET // UK EYES ONLY

### 1. Overall Assessment

Following the "Day of Ashes" mass-casualty terrorist attack on UK soil, intelligence identified the perpetrator as **Al-Khaima Front (AKF)**, a transnational terrorist organization. AKF operates a sophisticated and compartmentalized network spanning the UK and a foreign sanctuary known as **"Lythium."**

The network's cross-border finance, logistics, and international coordination are controlled by a single high-value individual codenamed **'THE FERRYMAN'**.

### 2. The Insider Threat

Intelligence indicates with high confidence that details of **OP SILENT HERMES** (the Korea campaign) were leaked to hostile elements. The leak appears to originate from a UK government or military source. This suggests OPSEC has been compromised at a strategic level.

### 3. Key Actors

* **THE FERRYMAN (Active):** Intelligence broker and facilitator. Has access to high-level UK government information.
* **THE MASON (KIA):** Network leader, responsible for organisation and logistics on Sanda Island and in Lythium.
* **ABU MIRAJ (Captured):** Weapons specialist. Captured during the raid on Sanda Island.

### 4. Operational Objective

UKSF has been tasked with conducting phased counter-terrorism operations to locate, disrupt, and dismantle the AKF leadership and infrastructure, neutralizing their capability to conduct further attacks against the UK and its allies.
