## 1. Executive Summary
Recent SIGINT captures from the **18 (UKSF) Signal Regiment** have identified a high-frequency communications node operating out of a previously dormant facility. 

## 2. Adversarial Disposition
- **Strength:** Estimated 2 x Platoon-sized elements.
- **Equipment:** Soviet-era technicals and encrypted man-portable radios.
- **Activity:** Frequent 'Wait Out' transmissions suggest coordination with a higher command tier.

## 3. Recommended Actions
- **SRR:** Initiate long-term covert surveillance of the node.
- **SAS:** Be prepared to execute a Close Target Reconnaissance (CTR) on order.
- **SBS:** Monitor littoral extraction routes for potential maritime intervention.

## 4. Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) Notes
The node uses a non-standard frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS).
