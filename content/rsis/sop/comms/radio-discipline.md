## 1. Principles of Radio Discipline
- **Accuracy:** Ensure all reports are precise and verified.
- **Brevity:** Keep transmissions short to deny adversarial direction finding (DF) opportunities.
- **Clarity:** Use standard RSVP (Rhythm, Speed, Volume, Pitch).

## 2. Standard Prowords
- **ROGER:** I have received your last transmission.
- **WILCO:** I have received, understood, and will comply.
- **OUT:** This exchange is ended; no response is expected.
- **WAIT OUT:** I must pause; I will call you back.
